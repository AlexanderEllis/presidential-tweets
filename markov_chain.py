# Markov-chain generator

def generate_markov_chain(text):
	"""
	Input assumes text is a long string with words separated by spaces with no new lines.  This requires some changes to most transcripts ahead of time.  
	Output will be a dictionary with each word as a key and a list of words that follow that word as the value.  For a basic model, I won't calculate percentages for each word, but will instead rely on accessing a random index when I use the chain later.

	For a basic version, I'm creating a Markov chain of length 1 for now
