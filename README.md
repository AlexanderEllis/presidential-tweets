# Trum.py Tweet Generator

This is a Donald Trump tweet generator.  It creates Markov Chains based off of text input, then it generates a tweet-sized text output based off of the Markov chains. 

## Getting Started


The repo comes with the Markov chains created, but if you make edits and want to regenerate them, you can run the following:
```
python generate_chains.py
```

To generate a Trump tweet in the command line:

```
python trum.py
```

## Sample tweets

Here are 3 randomly generated tweets:

```
>python trum.py
>More! I didn't want to post season. http://www.trumpnationalwestchester.com/ I'll be stronger than dinner discussing @BarackObama's...
```

```
>python trum.py
>Bedford, New Hampshire soon by @JenniferJJacobs: â€œTrump Not capable! Will be!
```

```
>python trum.py
>Party--hope he is enthusiastic about my @SRQRepublicans speech! Sad. @The_Iron_Lad Conservative! @MEEDColin Yes, she stated, we go inside?
```

Feel free to play with it and see if you can generate better tweets, and let me know if you do anything fun with it!
